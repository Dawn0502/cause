gwas_merge(X1, X2, X1_formatted = FALSE, X2_formatted = FALSE,
  snp_name_cols = c("snp", "snp"), beta_hat_cols = c("beta_hat",

\arguments{
\item{X1}{data.frame with data for GWAS 1}

\item{X2}{data.frame with data for GWAS 2}

\item{snp_name_cols}{A vector of length 2 specifying the name of the snp column
in X1 and X2 respectively. This is the column on which the data will be merged.}

\item{se_cols}{A vector of length 2 specifying the name of the snp column
in X1 and X2 respectively.}

\item{A1_cols}{Column names for effect allele}

\item{A2_cols}{Column names for other allele}

\item{beta_hat_col}{A vector of length 2 specifying the name of the snp column
in X1 and X2 respectively. If effect sizes are provided as odds ratios they must be converted
back into coeffecient estimates by taking the log.}
}
\value{
An object of class cause_data and data.frame.
}
\description{
Format GWAS summary statistics for CAUSE
}
\details{
This function will try to merge data sets X1 and X2 on the specified columns. Where
necessary, it will flip the sign of effects so that the effect allele is the same in both
data sets. It will remove variants with ambiguous alleles or where the alleles (G/C or A/T) or
with alleles that do not match between data sets (e.g A/G in one data set and A/C in the other).
It will not remove variants that are simply strand flipped between the two data sets (e. g. A/C in one data set, T/G in the other).
